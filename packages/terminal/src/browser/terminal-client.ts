/**

 * responcible to create connection with backend, send output to the terminal widget, and send user input from terminal widget.
 * Terminal client should create connection with terminal server side and send user input from terminal widget to the terminal backend, move
 * terminal output from terminal backend to the terminal widget. Potentionally terminal backend could be separed service isolated of Theia.
 * This interface provide extensibility terminal wiget and terminal server side. This common interface allow to use different implementation
 * terminal widget for the same terminal backend. Also it's allow to reuse current terminal widget to comunication with some custom server side.
